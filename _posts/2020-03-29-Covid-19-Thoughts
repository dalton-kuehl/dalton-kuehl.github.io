The announcements from local authorities about shutting down nonessential businesses triggered quite the response in the stock market and the super markets. Stock prices fell in the sharpest decline since World War II. A lot of people are seeing their retirement accounts mirror the stock market. The grocery stores quickly ran out of "pandemic supplies" which appeared to be copious amounts of toilet paper and bread - clearly the essentials.

I guess I wanted to write this because throughout this volatility and uncertainty, I've felt overwhelmingly calm. It feel like I'm going against the stream as people are asking if I've seen the latest stock prices and if I'm buying or selling or the like. 

In times of uncertaintity such as this, I think it becomes very clear why having some type of plan, especially when it comes to money, is so important. Financially, this looks like an [Investment Policy Statement](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/619888/making-your-investment-policy-statement). Sounds fancy and complicated, but it really isn't. Basically this is plan that you create during time of emotional and market stability so that when the volatility happens, you don't make any emotion-based response that could hurt your long term financial goals. For me this basically means I'm going to continue contributing as much as I can into my pre-tax buckets. My response to friends and family about this stock market sunertaitiny is quite boring: I'm going to keep investing the same way I have been. I'm not saying this should be everyone's strategy, but what I am saying is that I have a plan (IPS) and I'm sticking to it. 

The other thing I think is incredibly important is having some type of Emergency Fund. It was shocking to me when I saw this infographic.

Based on this, many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck or pretty darn close and that means that could be a very large number of people in some serious financial trouble if (and when) this economic impact extends beyond 1 or 2 months. 

But an emergency fund can look like a lot of different things to different people. For me, it basically means that I keep 1 month's worth of expenses in my checking account and then 3-6 month's worth of expenses in a brokerage account. The 1 month in my checking allows me to pay all my bills with "old money" as in it's last month's money that I'm paying the current month's bills with. It makes it so I never have to worry about putting something on my card or a larger expense. This is my *typical* plan but because I have been on the search for a house, I have an unusually large cash reserve that I have placed in a high yield savings account (I use [WealthFront](https://www.wealthfront.com/c/affiliates/invited/AFFD-H6WP-BEG3-BZWS), although they seem to have dropped their rates lower than other banks). This also has given me tremendous comfort because I now have close to 1 years worth of expenses saved up there. 

My general framework that I've been practicing has been the concept of Locus of Control. There are hundreds of things that we cannot control about this coronavirus and its impacts to our financials and our health and wellbeing of others. But the locus of control concept instead is asking you to focus on the things you can control. Don't let the world happen to you, you happen to the world.

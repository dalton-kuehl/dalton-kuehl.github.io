# Health Related Data

All of this data was gathered using my Garmin watch(es). 

## Total Activities

In 2019, I tracked a total of **372 unique activities!** That's more than 1 per day! üí™

That probably doesn't mean these were all very diversified or time consuming activities as I would count walking around the dog park as hiking sometimes (it's a big dog park). But hey, that's pretty cool. It also appears that I front-loaded my activity tracking, and progressively tracked less and less throughout the year - interesting piece of data that I will want to change. 

Q1 = 125 activities

Q2 = 92 activities

Q3 = 83 activities

Q4 = 71 activities

## Weight Lifting

I was particularly interested in two pieces of data with my workouts: number of workouts completed and number of calories burned. I separated my weight lifting into 3 different categories:

- Upper Body
- Lower Body
- Fully Body

Here is the summary of weight lifting activities tracked: 

- Q1 = 68 activities
- Q2 = 42 activities
- Q3 = 43 activities
- Q4 = 33 activities

My workouts trended down with my total activities previously mentioned -  I got lazy. 

I burned an average of **301 calories** per workout, which intuitively feels about right. Here is the data for each workout type: 

### Average Calories per Workout Type

Upper Body = 258

Lower Body = 203

Full Body = 409

Strength (untracked) = 293

And Full Body workouts (not surprisingly) takes the cake! üç∞ Interestingly enough, my average lower body calories were *lower* than my average calories burned for my upper body. I must be taking it easy on leg day. 

# Financial Data

## Savings Rate

For 2019 I had the goal of hitting a 50% savings rate. I've been slowly chunking away at my lifestyle inflation that happened after starting my job here. That's probably a `separate` post in and of itself, but the big things I was trying to eliminate are

1. Car Payment - sold my 2018 Outback in favor of my wonderful 2006 Impreza
Lesson: **Never** make payments on a *depreciating* asset
2. Housing Expenses - In 2018, I moved into an high-priced apartment complex. In 2019, I got a roommate to help lower my monthly expenses. As of late, I have been looking to buy a house, which could reduce that monthly living expense to zero with renters/roommates. (or heck maybe in a make a few dollars ü§ë)
3. Discretionary Spending - I quit buying shit. I've been taking a minimalistic approach to my life which, to me, means the subtraction of negative things in my life, rather than adding the positive things. Here's a great [article](https://thehappyphilosopher.com/alligators-and-kittens/) I'd recommend reading on this topic. 

After tallying everything up, I barely squeaked by with a savings rate of **51.03%**! I was not really expecting that! 

In the future, I'm going to be revamping how I input my money into my master budget file. I'm really behind the times because I just learned about pivot tables, which seems like it would make the process more efficient. My current process involves the following:

1. Have all of my accounts linked to [Mint.com](http://mint.com)
2. Spend 5-15 minutes weekly to ensure the transactions are appropriately labeled
3. Export the transactions at the end of the month to a CSV file
4. Use the CSV file to create a table in excel and sort by category
5. Manually go through and fix any anomalies/errors and sum up each of the different categories. 
6. Then I input the summed categories into an excel spreadsheet and calculate my savings rate based on my "theoretical" net income. 

This is entirely inefficient and could be a LOT simpler. I will be revamping this process going into 2020. More details on that later. 

## Average Expenses

My average monthly expenses, another important metric I was looking for (to help with future projections and optimization) are shown below:

There were a handful of anomalies throughout the year - `going to Taiwan`, buying mattresses, etc. But overall the results looks good. Another thing I changed is that I recently starting tracking my inflow sections so that data is really just over the last 3-4 months. I figured that would give me much more accurate number for my savings rate. 

A few other insights that I pulled from my spreadsheet

- I had a 70% savings rate in October. This is mainly because I got all of my expenses for my trip to Taiwan reimbursed at this time
- I earned over $4,400 in side hustle income! This includes Rover, Clinical Trials, and my work Wellness Program which pays cash out passively for being active
- I paid down over $3,400 in student loan debt. This was not a priority for me as I already have all my high interest loans paid off, but still a nice number nonetheless.
- I brought my grocery budget down to $300 per month, previously this number was at around $400. I'm currently doing a Frugal Challenge with one of the main areas of focus being my grocery bill. More to come on that later. (As I am writing this, I realize I have a lot of other things to write)

As you might be able to tell, my estimated savings rate and my real savings rate might not add up correctly, but that is why I'm going to revamp my master budget spreadsheet this quarter. I think the takeaway is that I largely succeeded in getting a "close" to 50% savings rate and I will take that as win!

# Miscellaneous

I started tracking a few time-based things using an app called Toggle. It's relatively easy to use and very customizable. But 2 pieces of personal information that I wanted to track were:

## Reading

A lot of people say they want to read X number of books a year or a month - myself being one of them. Well throughout the year I basically started to fall off this goal and I had no idea by how much or why. I remember hearing in the internets (podcast? blog?) that if it's important to you, you will track and measure it. So I started tracking how much time I spent reading. 

I started tracking this in November and since then I have read over 27 hours. That number feels low. I'm very interested to see how that looks as time goes on. Also there was a huge drop off in December. Yikes.

## Cooking

I also started to track my cooking efforts. There's 2 main reasons why I wanted to track this.

1. To see how much time, on average, my meal preparation takes
and
2. To show people that eating healthy and meal prepping does not need to be an 8 hour ordeal

Wow. That's pretty crazy. I am spending under an hour and half meal prepping each week! This is partly due to my new approach to cooking: simplicity. I've been taking notes and reading works from a very fit dude by the name of Marcus Filly. He preaches a number of things, but 2 things have shown through to me - simplicity and mindfulness. I've been trying to incorporate these approaches into my meal preparation and also my life. 

The other big thing to note here is that this include prepping the food, cooking the food, and cleaning up after I'm done, so this really is an all inclusive number. It can be done people! Also to note - I have been doing this for well over 6 years now. So your first time will not be this fast! It takes practice.

# Conclusion

- This post is way too long
- I actually gleaned a lot of information that I thought was cool
- I have a handful of ways I'd like to improve on my data collection methods and data analysis methods
- Glad I wrote this
